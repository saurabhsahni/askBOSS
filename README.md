# askBOSS

askBoss retrieves images to questions posed in natural language. askBoss attempts to enhance image results for queries around factual question answering. It uses Yahoo Boss (Search) APIs (http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/) through Boss Mashup framework (http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/mashup.html) and is deployed on Google App Engine.

This hack is an extension of Vik Singhâ€™s qna service (http://bossy.appspot.com/), which finds answer (http://zooie.wordpress.com/2008/08/04/yahoo-boss-google-app-engine-integrated/) using the popular phrases in the top search results for a query. I do image search for the best answers and blend them with the regular image search results. The hack is a basic prototype and natural language image search gets triggered only for questions (queries including who/what/which).
